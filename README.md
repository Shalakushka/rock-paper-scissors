# Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. The game pits a human player against the computer, each round determining a winner based on the traditional rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

The game is developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## How to Play

1. Open the console in your browser.
2. Run the `playGame` function to start the game.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your choices for each round.
4. View the results and scores in the console after each round and at the end of the game.

## Future Enhancements

Currently, this project is limited to console-based interactions. However, future enhancements will introduce a graphical user interface (GUI), transforming it into a fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played directly on a webpage. This upcoming GUI version will feature buttons, text displays, and interactive elements, providing a more user-friendly and visually appealing gaming experience.
